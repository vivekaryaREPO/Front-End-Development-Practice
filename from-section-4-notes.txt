--SECTION 4:Lecture 1:--

1. You can write css at 3 places:
    a) in a separate file and link into html file where you wanna use it. 
       You can link it using <link> tag and use rel,href attribute on link 
       tag on it, rel="stylesheet", href="path of the file" #last_priority.

    b) or use it inside <style> tag of <head> tag of html file where you wanna apply css. #second last priority
    
    c) inside the element itself as an attribute. #highest priority.

2. If you mention a style twice for the same element in a same file/or inside element/or separate file,
    the style mentioned at the last is considered to be the latest one and It'll have the highest priority.


--SECTION 4:Lecture 2:--

1. There are three ways to choose color:
    eg. h1{
        color:red;
    }
    check colors from fontawesome.com
    body{
        bgc:red; //bgc=>background color or background-color.
    }
    => use hash values to give colors.
    => or use rgb() i.e red green blue, so rgb(10,20,30) means 10% red,20% blue,30%blues

2.Use your color picker plugh in to get the rgb values of hash values of color.


--SECTION 4:Lecture 3:--

1. Coming soon template-project
2. use body{
    background-image: url("../images//bg1.jpg");
} to repeat a certain image continuously into a page as whole.

3. To use a single image as whole in a page use:
body{
    background: url("../images/bgcat.jpeg");
    no-repeat center center fixed  ; don't repeat the image, make it centre from everywher(left,right,top,bottom), and make it fixed, i.e do not change image size on decrease or increase of page size
    background-size:cover; //we want this image to be a cover image
}

--SECTION 4:Lecture 4:--

lets move text in the project
click on element-> inspect ->computed= the blue content is your conten i.e the one you clicked for inspect
1. use width:valuepx to get an element which is not screen long wide
2. padding:valuepx is to get space between the text and border of the element
3.margin-top:valuepx to get a space from top on an element.
4. to get an element to a centre of a page, and adjust when the device size is increased or decreased
    a) margin:0 auto;
        0=>margin from top and bottom is 0.
        auto=>margin from left and right should be equal and should be best fit to device.
    
    b)margin-top:300px
        if only margin is defined, like above, it means we are defining top,bottom,left right in one property itself i.e margin:0 auto.
        and along with margin if you also explicitly specify margin-top , it means you are overriding the top value of
        the margin property you have defined before. Note: margin property is always relative to the previous element i.e it always
        takes pixels from the one element above it.



5. by default an element is on left, you can bring it to centre/right etc using text-align:center /text-align:left.
6.border: px type color  => used to define the element border property.

--SECTION 4:Lecture 5:--

                        <div class ="pink"></div>
}

.black{                     html
